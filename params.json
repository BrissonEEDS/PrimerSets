{"name":"SWGA","tagline":"Workflow to select primers for selective whole-genome amplification (SWGA)","body":"# Selective whole genome amplification\r\nSelective whole-genome amplification (SWGA) is a way to specifically amplify a target genome over background sample DNA. \r\nFor instance, we can design a set of primers that amplify a parasite's genome in a sample that is overwhelmingly composed of host DNA. For more information, see [Leichty & Brisson, _Genetics_, 2014](http://www.genetics.org/content/198/2/473.long).\r\n\r\nThis software is built to find sets of compatible PCR primers that can be used for SWGA. It can be run on a range of hardware, from personal laptops to computing clusters and servers.\r\n\r\n## Features:\r\n- Counts all the possible primers in a size range in both genomes\r\n- Filters primers based on:\r\n  - foreground and background genome binding rates\r\n  - melting temperatures (with a built-in melt temp calculator that accounts for mono- and divalent cation solutions!)\r\n  - Possible homodimerization\r\n- Finds primer sets containing primers that are compatible with each other using graph theory (largest clique formation). The process ensures:\r\n  - No primer in a set is a heterodimer\r\n  - Even binding site spacing in foreground genome\r\n  - Low total binding to background genome\r\n- Score each set based on certain binding metrics and allows exploration of high-scoring sets via output to common formats.\r\n\r\n## Using SWGA\r\n\r\nFollow the installation instructions [here](https://github.com/eclarke/swga/wiki/Installation), then visit [Quick Start](https://github.com/eclarke/swga/wiki) to get started!\r\n\r\n### Quick start:\r\n\r\n- [Install guide](https://github.com/eclarke/swga/wiki/Installation)\r\n- [Getting started](https://github.com/eclarke/swga/wiki/)\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nCheck out the wiki, mailing list (swga-dev@googlegroups.com), or contact me at @eclarke.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
