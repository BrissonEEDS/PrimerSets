{"name":"SWGA","tagline":"Workflow to select primers for selective whole-genome amplification (SWGA)","body":"### Welcome to SWGA.\r\nSelective whole-genome amplification (SWGA) is a way to specifically amplify a genome above a background. This code is a self-contained workflow for identifying primer sets for use in this process.\r\n\r\n### Quick start:\r\n\r\nFollow the installation instructions [here](https://github.com/eclarke/swga/wiki/Installation), then simply follow these instructions in a directory of your choice:\r\n```sh\r\n./activate_swga\r\nswga init\r\nswga autopilot\r\n```\r\nAll the parameters can be fine-tuned in a configuration file called `default_parameters.cfg` in the directory you ran `swga init`. For tips and tricks for optimizing these parameters, see the SWGA [wiki](https://github.com/eclarke/swga/wiki/).\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nCheck out the wiki, mailing list, or contact me at @eclarke.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
