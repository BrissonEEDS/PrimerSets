SWGA Changelog
===================

Version 0.3.1
--------------------
This update brings a few new features and a couple bugfixes. The primer database
and parameters file have changed, so be sure to run `swga init` and `swga count`
again on any current projects.
What's new:
- Search the primer compatibility graph using multiple independent workers. This
  may allow users to find better sets faster, but since the graph coloring is
  randomized, this is not guaranteed.  
- Users can now score single sets using `swga score`
- Users can now activate custom sets using `swga activate`
- `swga init` now handles blank lines in FASTA files
- Restored original scoring metric
- Better unit test coverage
